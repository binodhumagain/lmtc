				<p> I extend heartiest thankfulness and warmest welcome to you for viewing the official website of the Land Management Center (LMTC). LMTC is a government organization under the Ministry of Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation of the Government of Nepal. LMTC is situated at Dhulikhel of Kavrepalanchok district.
				In the history of Surveying and Mapping education in Nepal, formal education began with the establishment of Survey Training Center (Napi Talim Kendra) in July, 1968. The center has been playing a key role in producing the human resources for different levels as per the need of the Government of Nepal over the years. Initially, the center was established to fulfill the then requirements of land surveyors (amin) to carry out systematic cadastral survey in the country. The center was mandated to produce land surveyors (amin) by conducting Amin Training of eight months duration. Soon after the commencement of the Amin Training, Junior Survey’ Training of one year duration was introduced to produce Surveyors or Survey Inspectors. In November 1971, after three years of the establishment of the center, Senior Survey Training of one year duration was launched in order to produce human resources who could work as Survey Officers.</p>
				<p>Realizing the impact it had in the field of surveying and mapping, Government of Nepal upgraded the then Survey Training Center to Land Management Training Center (LMTC) in July, 2000, and designated additional responsibility to conduct training courses for the capacity building in the Lland Management sector, in addition to Surveying and Mapping.</p>
				<p>Convinced with the need of the time to conduct the academic programs in the field of Surveying and Mapping in the country, the center joined hands with Kathmandu University and launchedto run undergraduate course in Geomatics Engineering in 2007. This collaboration has continued with the additional courses namely Master of Land Administration and Geoinformatics, and Diploma in Geomatics Engineering. Council of Technical Education and Vocational Training (CTEVT) is also a partner of the collaboration for the Diploma course.</p>
				<p>A number of short-term courses are also being offeredf at the center to enhance the capacity of the civil personnel working in the sector of Surveying and Mapping, and Land Administration in the country. The recent target of the center is to contribute in the capacity development of the Local Government in Land Management sector.
				The center has set its vision to be the “Center of Excellence in Land Management and Geomatics Education”. In order to meet this vision, the center is working towards enhancing the capacity of the center itself. The center has initiated research based activities in the sector of Geomatics and Land Management mainly focusing in the institutional development and policy reform. The center has started to publish a scientific journal entitled “Journal of Land Management and Geomatics Education” as an annual publication and other various programs on capacity development of the center are in thorough plan.
				Our best efforts are underway to meet the vision of the center. Please explore the information included in the website and do not hesitate to contact us if you have any query and critical/constructive feedback.</p>
				Thanking you</br>
				Ganesh Prasad Bhatta</br>
				Executive Director</br>
